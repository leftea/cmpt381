**CMPT-381 (Implementation of Graphical User Interfaces) term project

## Overview

Eyedeas is a paint app with a special twist to saving: Rather than save as file names, 
you can create a custom image representing your painting and save it inside a draggable,
tap-to-load your painting, shape on the main screen!

## Inspiration

Ever need to load a file, e.g. a specific drawing, or the actual good copy of your project or essay, and not sure which one it was?
Ever save a file, but can't think of a name and it ends up as untitled?
Yeah, me too. I think we're all familiar with this.
Well, **untitled no more!!!*** With eyedeas, by saving your drawings with visual representations,
you will never again waste hours of your precious time loading files, closing files, and loading more files while pulling out your hair to find the 
right drawing.
