  "body": "# Eyedeas\r\n**CMPT-381** (Implementation of Graphical User Interfaces) term project, University of Saskatchewan\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nEyedeas is a paint app with a special twist to saving: Rather than save as file names, \r\nyou can create a custom image representing your painting and save it inside a draggable,\r\ntap-to-load your painting, shape on the main screen!\r\n\r\n## Inspiration\r\n\r\nEver need to load a file, e.g. a specific drawing, or the actual good copy of your project or essay, and not sure which one it was?\r\nEver save a file, but can't think of a name and it ends up as untitled?\r\nYeah, me too. I think we're all familiar with this annoyance.\r\nWell, **UNTITLED NO MORE!** With eyedeas, by saving your drawings with visual representations,\r\nyou will never again waste hours of your precious time loading files, closing files, and loading more files while pulling out your hair to find the right drawing.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nThis project is a work in progress. Since this is part of a single term class project, the first production-ready version of the application will be ready mid April, and the project will be open source once published in the Google Play Store (Between May-July, 2016)\r\n\r\n## About us\r\n\r\nWe are two students at the University of Saskatchewan, collectively majoring in Computer Science, Interactive Systems Design, and Psychology.",
